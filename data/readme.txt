The files in this folder contain information about elements that form compounds (for model V0), subelemental composition (for model V1), as well as IDs and formula/SMILE identifiers.

Please note that the CSV file for organic compounds may contain a smaller number of structures compared to the reference dataset. This is because some SMILES forms cannot be converted to XYZ format using programs like Open Babel or RDKit.

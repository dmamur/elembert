This folder contains two subfolders:

- pcakm: This folder contains models that reduce the PDF vector to a 2D array and K-means models that classify elements into subelements based on PCA output.

- Pretrained: This folder contains dictionary files for the V0 and V1 models, which transform elements (or subelements) into integers according to the el2id dictionary.
